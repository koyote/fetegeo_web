"""
 This class implements a simple "don't fill up beyond a certain point" dictionary cache. Effectively
 it maintains a current dictionary and an old dictionary; when the current dictionary overfills the
 old dictionary is overwritten with the current dictionary and a blank current dictionary is then
 used. Lookups and so on first try the current cache and, if that fails, look at the old cache. This
 means that frequently used items will continuously stay in the cache (as they make their way from
 the old to the current cache), while not taking up too much memory.
